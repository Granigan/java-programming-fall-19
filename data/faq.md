### I've got a problem with the TMC plugin

Make sure you've got the newest version of the TMC plugin by clicking `Help` -> `Check for Updates` on the top bar of Netbeans.

If you can't make it work, come to the workshops and we'll help you :)

### Netbeans freezes when the feedback window opens

This problem shouldn't be present in the newer version of the plugin. You can download it at `Help` -> `Check for updates` and following the instructions.

### I think one of the programming exercises has a bug

Make sure it's not a problem with your code. Ask for help in the telegram chat or in the workshop. Check for possible updates on the exercise by clicking `TMC` -> `Download or update exercises` on the top bar of Netbeans. If after all this you think there is a problem with the exercise, open a new issue in the github repo of the course: LINK.

### I found an error in the material

Open an issue or make a request in the Github repo: LINK.

### Doing the exercises and returning them is slow on macOS

Follow these instructions to fix the issue: https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/macos-verkkoongelma/.

If it doesn't help, try changing the proxy setting on Netbeans to "no proxy".

### The installer of Netbeans is not opening on macOS

Try clicking the installer with the right button of the mouse and then choose "Open".

### the tests of part are not working on my mac

Check these instructions: [macOS ohjeet](/macos-ohjeet)

### while running the tests, I get an error about JAVA_HOME

Follow these instructions: [https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/](https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/).

### Netbeans or its installer doesn't open, or looks odd when opening

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 installed. The environment used on this course doesn't work properly with newer versions of Java. If you have a problem with this, try removing the newer versions of Java on your computer, and then install "Netbeans with TMC" again.

### The buttons to run and to send to the server on Netbeans are gray

This usually indicates either passed deadline or wrong course being selected in `TMC` -> `Settings`.

### I want to apply for study right through the programming mooc. Is this the right course?

No, you cannot apply for the study right based on this course.
